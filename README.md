Create a personal landing page using HTML and CSS for practice

### Some ideas off of the top of my head

- Main page will be simple. Neutral colors. Simple font. (Need to choose color combinations)
- Main page will have two options (Not sure if this is a very good idea for a personal portfolio site. But seems like a feature that is worth working on for practice purposes)
  - 1. Click on a button to navigate to my developer portfolio page.
  - 2. Click on a button to navigate to my drawing portfolio page.
  
## Developer

- Need to choose colors and font.
  - Looking for something bright and bold, but not too distracting to the eyes
  - Font should be something simple.
- Need to take profile photo
  - Doesn't need to be professional, but it does need to be presentable.
- Since I never had training in tech, and my "career" has been non-existent, I need to emphasize that I am passionate about developing a career in coding. It's something that I find very rewarding and I can see my self enjoying this as a career.
  - I could also emphasize that the various work experiences that I have prove that I am a fast learner. I am versatile and adaptable to new environments.
- Add links to FCC projects (Need to touch up the projects to make it look more presentable)
- Header should stay fixed with nav-links. I should look into making the header disappear when the page is stationary.
- Dark mode (toggle button) would be a nice feature.

## Drawing

- Main page will have a rotating gallery of my drawings. Or should I have a static gallery?
- Since most of my work is black/white, the page should be black and white. Or should I add color? Dark Earth tones? or corlor mode and B/W toggle button?
- Name at top. With nav-links to 'Main', 'About', 'Prints (shop should have target="_blank")', 'contact' (for commissions)
